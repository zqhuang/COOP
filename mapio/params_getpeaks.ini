#********************  OUTPUT FILE **********************
#Stacking points and orientation information is saved in a fits image (workdir/output) that contains 6 columns:
# pix theta  phi  rotation_angle  xscale  yscale
# pix is the pixel number (for healpix maps use nested ordering)
#(theta, phi) is the spherical coordinate;
# angle defines the local x-axis direction (w.r.t. the horizontal direction)
# xscale is the stretch factor in the local x-axis direction
# yscale is the stretch factor in the local y-axis direction
